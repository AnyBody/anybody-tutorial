# Lesson 2: Linear Muscle Recruitment

{{ caution_old_tutorial }}

Let us begin this lesson with a physiological observation. We know that
there is a metabolic cost involved in development of muscle force. Food
is a limited resource for living organisms so it is likely that nature
has programmed us to save muscle work in some sense. But exactly how?

When two muscles are sharing the load of one joint moment, the options
seem to be:

- Letting muscle 1 do the work
- Letting muscle 2 do the work
- Letting the two muscles share the work as we saw in the previous
  lesson

So we can reduce the load on one muscle, but the cost will be more work
remaining for the other muscle to do. It seems that a criterion taking
both muscles into account is needed. Let us just briefly recall the
formulation of the muscle recruitment problem again:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
& {\text{minimize}}
& & G\left(\mathbf{f^{(M)}}\right) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathbf{Cf} = \mathbf{r} \\
&&& f_i^{(M)} \geq 0, i=1\ldots n^{(M)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$

The simplest imaginable choice of objective function taking the effort
of both muscles into account seems to be a linear combination like this:

$$
G = \frac{f_1}{N_1}+ \frac{f_2}{N_2}
$$

i.e., a linear combination of the two muscle forces, where the $N_1$ and  $N_2$
are some choice of normalization factors. Thinking about the physiology
we might quickly get the idea that it is reasonable if strong muscles do
more work than weak muscles, so $N_i$ acould be measures of the
strength of each muscle. We are going to stick with that idea for the
remainder of this tutorial because it actually turns out to make sense
also experimentally. We can get AnyBody to work with precisely this
definition by making the following additions to our study:

```AnyScriptDoc
AnyBodyStudy MyStudy = {
    AnyFolder &Model = .MyModel;
    Gravity = {0.0, -9.81, 0.0};
    nStep = 1000; // Lots of time steps to make it run slowly enough
    ยง InverseDynamics.Criterion = {
        Type = MR_Linear;
    };ยง
};
```

This small addition specifies that the muscles must be recruited as a
linear combination. The muscles forces are automatically normalized by
the strengths. Running the analysis and plotting the result as before
leaves us with this somewhat surprising result:

It seems that the weaker M2 is slacking around doing nothing and leaving
all the work to the stronger M1. It turns out that we always get this
type of behavior when recruiting muscles with a linear objective
function. In general, this method will only recruit the minimum number
of muscles to balance the system, and the chosen muscles are those that
by combination of their moment arms and strengths are best suited for
the purpose. While this might be a reasonable strategy, it is
unfortunately totally non-physiological. It is possible to measure
activity in muscles electrically, and these measurements show without a
doubt that several muscles spanning the same joint share the load
between them.

This type of muscle recruitment is included in AnyBody for two reasons
despite being non-physiological:

1. For completeness. The strategy behind AnyBody is to leave decisions
   about physiology to the user as much as possible.
2. This type of analysis is excellent for identifying the important
   muscles in a complex system in a given posture and external load. In
   complex systems this can be very challenging to determine manually
   and the result can be useful for a variety of purposes including
   decisions on tendon transfer surgery.

For normal purposes, however, the linear criterion is not a good choice,
and we shall therefore proceed to investigate another option in
