# Introduction: Getting Started with Modeling

Developing accurate models of the human body from scratch is an enormous task.
It is thus practical to use the models in the [The AnyBody Managed Model
Repository](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc)
as a starting template for a new application.

The following elements of the AnyScript language make such templating easier:

- Include files - Which aid templating and sharing model components across different applications
- Body model parameters - For customizing the default AMMR body models

The AMMR installation folder also contains a library of [demo applications](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/auto_examples/index.html)
such as MoCap gait, cycling, leg-press exercises etc. If any of these applications are similar to your end goal, you can copy the
application's model files and then modify them as required.

**But in this tutorial, you will build a model from the bottom-up using the AMMR model templates.**

This tutorial is based on version {{ AMMR_VERSION_SHORT }} of the AnyBody Managed Model
Repository. This the latest AMMR version and the tutorial may not be fully relevant
if you are using an AnyBody Modeling System prior to version {{ AMS_VERSION_SHORT }}. 

With that done, please proceed to Lesson 1: {doc}`Starting with a new Model <lesson1>` using a template.
