Introduction: Getting Started with Modeling
============================================

Developing accurate models of the human body from scratch is an enormous task.
It is thus practical to use the models in the `The AnyBody Managed Model
Repository <https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc>`__
as a starting template for a new application.

The following elements of the AnyScript language make such templating easier:

-   Include files - Which aid templating and sharing model components across different applications

-   Body model parameters - For customizing the default AMMR body models

The AMMR installation folder also contains a library of `demo applications <https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/auto_examples/index.html>`__ 
such as MoCap gait, cycling, leg-press exercises etc. If any of these applications are similar to your end goal, you can copy the 
application's model files and then modify them as required.

**But in this tutorial, you will build a model from the bottom-up using the AMMR model templates.**

This tutorial is based on version |AMMR_VERSION_SHORT| of the AnyBody Managed Model
Repository. This the latest AMMR version and the tutorial may not be fully relevant
if you are using an AnyBody Modeling System prior to version |AMS_VERSION_SHORT|.
