"This is a very relevant question indeed. Computer models are just that: a"
" model of reality, and there will always be some amount of approximation "

"AnyBody Modeling System because it is tailor-made for the complexity of "

"The muscle primarily responsible for carrying the load over a joint does "

"The model has attained a posture in which the moment arm of a primary "
"muscle erroneously becomes zero or negative. This can happen, for "
"instance, if a wrapping muscle slides off its wrapping surface. The "
"variation of muscle length with the joint angle reflects the moment arm, "
"so if the moment arm is too small, then the muscle will have little "
"length variation when the joint is articulated."

"If the model makes use of a muscle model with stength/length variation "
"and passive stiffness, then a tendon length that is poorly calibrated to "
"the model can cause malfunction of its muscle. A too long tendon will "
"cause its muscle to have little or no strength in its usual operation "
"interval. A too short tendon will cause a muscle to excert passive force "
"and likely cause muscles on the other side of the joint to work more than"
" they are supposed to. Please notice that AnyBody has facilities for "
"calibrating tendon lengths. :doc:`*The muscle modeling tutorial* "
"</Muscle_modeling/intro>` has in-depth information about these issues."

"Input to inverse dynamics is movement and boundary conditions, and these "

"Consider a hand gripping a handle firmly. Apparently, the hand is rigidly"
" connected to the handle, and you might be inclined to define a model "
"connection between the two elements reflecting this notion. However, "
"hands have limited strength to hold on with, and handle surfaces have "
"limited friction to offer. If the model contrary to reality offers an "
"effortless connection between the hand and the handle, then the model is "
"likely to exploit this as we shall see later."

"Recorded movement input such as motion capture data is usually in the "

"orders of magnitude. This is the topic of the first lesson of this "

"As mentioned a couple of times already, the AnyBody Modeling System is "
"based on inverse dynamics. This means that - for a given point in time - "
"the system solves the equilibrium equations and resolves the interior "
"muscle and joint forces. Since these time steps are solved independently "
"of each other, the state can in principle shift abruptly from one step to"
" the next, whereas, in reality, a change of muscle tone requires a bit of"
" time. Force development in a muscle is the result of an electric signal "
"from the central nervous system, which starts a chemical process in the "
"muscle and eventually leads to contraction. All this is done within a few"
" milliseconds, and inverse dynamics disregards this small time delay. It "
"means that if the movement is very quick and the system predicts very "
"rapid changes of muscle activation, then the result may not be realistic."
msgstr ""

"Another possible source of error is the distribution of force between the"
" muscles. The body has more muscles than strictly necessary to carry most"
" loads, so is infinitely many different combinations of muscle forces "
"will balance the external loads. The way AnyBody picks the right one is "
"by an optimality criterion. The system presumes that the body wants to "
"make the best of its resources. The user has some amount of control over "
"this criterion, but in its basic form it is a minimum fatigue criterion "
"that distributes the loads as evenly as possible between the muscles "
"taking their individual strengths into account. Please refer to :doc:`*A "
"Study of Studies* </A_study_of_studies/intro>` for more detailed "
"information."

"So the system basically presumes that the body has the knowledge and the "
"desire to activate muscles optimally. This is supported by a lot of "
"research, but the precise criterion employed by the body is a matter of "
"continuous discussion. Furthermore, the ability to instantly choose the "
"optimal muscle recruitment most likely requires that the movement is "
"skilled and that the required changes of muscle activation are not faster"
" than the electro-chemical process of muscle contraction can accommodate."

"All software has bugs, and very probably this is also the case for the "
"AnyBody Modeling System. However, in terms of muscle recruitment, the "
"validity of the software was validated independently in 2004 in a Ph.D. "
"thesis by Erik Forster from the University of Ulm, Germany. The thesis is"
" available from the list of `publications in the AnyScript Forum "
"<https://www.anybodytech.com/anybody.html?fwd=publications>`__. The basic"
" idea was to program an independent special-purpose application for gait "
"simulation and then compare it to an identical gait model in AnyBody. If "
"the results were identical, it would prove the correctness of the "
"algorithms of both systems. The result was that the output data of the "
"two systems were identical on all but a tiny fraction of the data. Closer"
" investigation of this tiny fraction revealed that different algorithms -"
" although mathematically similar - can produce slightly deviating results"
" due to round-off errors."

"When compared to the modeling errors and approximations due to the "
"recruitment assumptions, errors in the software are much less likely to "
"disturb the result of the computation significantly."

"The expression 'garbage in - garbage out' is very much valid for "
"biomechanical simulation. The quality of the output can never be better "
"than the input. This means that the first step of any validation is to "
"check the quality of the input. Input comes in the form of movements and "
"applied forces, where the former is the more difficult. A rough check of "
"the specified movements can be obtained by running a kinematic analysis "
"and charting the positions, velocities and above all accelerations of "
"characteristic points and segments in the model as illustrated for the "
"rowing model above. Notice that proximal body parts tend to be heavier "
"than distal body parts, so larger accelerations are plausible in the "
"distal parts."

"Gravity = 9.81 m/s^2 is a good measure to compare your values to. If the "

"positional information definitely needs careful reviewing and probably "
"smoothing with a low-pass filter."
