msgid ""
"To use the AnyForceSurfaceContact, it is necessary that the STL- or "
"AnySurf-file fulfils some requirements to obtain good results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid "The surface should not have sharp edges in the region of contact."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid ""
"Sharp edges can cause a jump in calculation of the penetration depth of "
"the two surfaces and thus can cause jumps in the contact force. For the "
"FDK-solver, this is not easy to handle and can cause slow convergence or "
"even failure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid "The surface should not have too large curvatures."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid ""
"Large curvatures on a surface cause, similar to sharp edges, lead to "
"jumps in the calculation depth."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid ""
"On the master surface in a contact pairing (i.e. the surface for which "
"distances for each vertex to the slave surface are calculated) big "
"curvatures on the surface means big variations of the vertex normal, "
"which are used to calculate the force direction. Thus, large curvatures "
"causes can cause large variations in the force directions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid "The surface should not contain too small triangles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid ""
"Small triangles, i.e. vertices which are too close to each other are "
"collapsed into one vertex during the process of converting STL-files to "
"AnySurf objects. Thus, too small triangles end up as degenerated "
"triangles with edges of zero length and without area. These triangles "
"must be ignored in the contact calculation and warnings show up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid ""
"The face normal for each face of the surface should have a unique "
"orientation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst
msgid ""
"Make sure that the surface normal and the numbering of triangles (best "
"counter clockwise for a consistent definition of the outer face normal) "
"are consistent. The normal is used to define inside and outside of the "
"surface and thus, which direction is penetration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/fdkappendix.rst:41
msgid ""
"To check the above mentioned requirements, you can use an external tool "
"such as MeshLab (https://www.meshlab.net/ ). To smooth sharp edges "
"and large curvatures, filters, such as Laplacian filters, or others can "
"be used, depending on the surface. Checking the face normals can be done "
"by using the function Render->Show Face Normal."
