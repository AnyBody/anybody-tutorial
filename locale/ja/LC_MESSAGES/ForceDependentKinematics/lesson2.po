"What we have now is a standard inverse dynamics AnyBody model capable of "
"computing forces in a knee joint that is presumed to be a simple hinge. "
"Real knees are unfortunately not as simple as that. Mechanically "
"speaking, the difference between an idealized revolute knee and a real "
"knee lies in the source of the forces which hold the joint together."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/lesson2.rst:13
msgid ""
"An idealized knee joint does not allow any deviations from its hinge "
"motion, like if the tibia and femur were to start sliding on one another."
" This is accomplished by joint reaction forces which will enforce the "
"zero sliding constraint, regardless of how large the required forces may "
"be."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/lesson2.rst:19
msgid ""
"The real knee does not work like that. The cartilage cushioning the "
"contact between the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau is elastic, "
"and so are the ligaments and menisci stabilizing the knee against free "
"sliding. Since the forces in these passive structures depend on their "
"deformation, zero deformation implies the absence of any stabilizing "
"force. In other words, the knee MUST deform a little to invoke these "
"stabilizing forces and retain its integrity."

"Let us begin the steps that will allow AnyBody to compute this "
"deformation. We zoom in on the definition of the knee joint and change "
"the definition of its reaction forces:"
msgstr ""

"Here we redefine one of the default properties of the joint: the "
"definition of constraints. As mentioned in “Getting Started: AnyScript "
"Programming, Lesson 3: Connecting segments by joints\", connecting two "
"completely independent rigid segments with a joint arrests some or all of"
" the six degrees of relative motion freedom that existed between the two."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this manner, a revolute joint imposes five constraints of which the "
"first three are translational constraints (preventing relative sliding) "
"whose violation is resisted by the joint reaction forces and the latter "
"two are rotational constraints (preventing relative, out of plane "
"rotation) enforced by reaction moments."

"The shank’s KneeCenter node - which is the joint’s default coordinate "
"system - has the *y* axis pointing proximally along the shank’s length "
"axis and the x axis pointing forward. These are the two directions in "
"which we’d like to introduce elastic stabilization of tibio-femoral "
"translation, so the first two components of the CType vector are changed "
"to the value ForceDep, which means that rather than being ‘Hard’ "
"constraints, the forces are now defined by some elastic element, which we"
" shall introduce later. We are thus switching off the usual reaction "
"forces in those directions by setting the Reaction.Type vector."

"Now let us add the necessary elasticity to the joint. This can be done "
"anywhere in the model, but we might as well place it just below the "
"joint:"

"We are using the AnyForce class for this purpose. AnyForce in an abstract"
" force that works on any kinematic measure we define inside it. In this "
"case, we simply refer to the linear measure which tracks the distance "
"between the two joint nodes on each segment. In an idealized joint, this "
"measure will always be zero as long as AnyBody can successfully enforce "
"all the translational constraints, however since the first two components"
" of CType are set to ‘ForceDep’, they can now vary and become non-zero."

"The *x* corresponds to sliding of the condyle along the tibial plateau. "
"In this direction, we can perceive the elasticity as primarily being "
"provided by the rim of the meniscus and the cruciate ligaments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/lesson2.rst:115
msgid ""
"The *y* direction is along the shank’s long axis and in this direction, "
"the elasticity is provided by the layer of cartilage between the tibial "
"plateau and the femoral condyles. The *z* axis points laterally but since"
" we are building a planar model of the knee, we leave it to be a "
"conventional hard constraint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is therefore likely that the stiffness in the *y* direction is "
"somewhat larger than in the *x* direction. We are going to define it that"
" way and also choose values that are much smaller than in the real knee "
"to get some nice, large deformations that are visually perceivable. So, "
"the definition of the actual force inside the AnyForce object looks like "
"this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/lesson2.rst:133
msgid ""
"As you can see, we simply specify the forces in the different directions "
"as mathematical functions of the Pos property of the lin measure. Pos "
"contains the actual linear displacements, and when we multiply those with"
" -1000 and -5000 respectively, we are generating spring forces that are "
"proportional and opposite to the translational deformation of the joint. "
"As discussed earlier, we have made the y direction stiffness five times "
"larger than the value for the *x* direction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/lesson2.rst:141
msgid ""
"One of the beauties of the AnyScript language is that these expressions "
"can be as complicated as you want. So if you happen to know more complex,"
" realistic stiffness properties of the knee from a cadaver study or from "
"a detailed finite element model, then you could just as well input those."

"Let’s get the final part of the definition finalized. All that is "
"remaining is to tell the solver in AnyBody that it should apply force-"
"dependent kinematics to solve the problem. This is of course done in the "
"study section:"

"That is all there is to it. The usual InverseDynamics operation will now "
"compute elastic deformations in the knee joint resulting from the "
"deformation of soft tissues in response to internal and external forces. "
"Go ahead and try it out. If something does not work, you can download a "
"functional model :download:`here <Downloads/DemoSimpleKnee2.any>`."

"**TROUBLESHOOTING HELP**: Inverse dynamics arrives at values of the force"
" dependent degrees of freedom (corresponding to the flexible joint "
"constraints) where the resulting passive stabilizing forces and computed "
"muscle forces, place those degrees of freedom in static equilibrium. This"
" is achieved by a gradient sensing optimizer which iteratively tries out "
"different combinations of joint deformation and muscle force magnitudes "
"which fulfil the equilibrium and optimization criteria."

"It may therefore be necessary to adjust optimization settings of the "
"AnyBodyStudy class such as “InverseDynamics.ForceDepKin.MaxNewtonStep” "
"and “InverseDynamics.ForceDepKin.Perturbation”. For example, a large "
"perturbation size implies a large finite-difference step for the knee "
"translation values when the optimizer computes gradients numerically. If "
"the knee stiffness was extremely non-linear, this gradient might not "
"reflect the local behaviour of the functions which the optimizer is "
"working with."

"When using more anatomically realistic body models containing passive "
"spring-like ligaments, it is good to ensure that the ligaments are "
"calibrated to ensure that their resting length isn’t too short or long. "
"You can read more on calibration in “Muscle Modeling, Lesson 7: "
"Ligaments” and “Inverse Dynamics of Muscle Systems, Lesson 7: "
"Calibration”."
