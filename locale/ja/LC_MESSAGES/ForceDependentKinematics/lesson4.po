"The knee model developed in the previous lessons is obviously very simple"
" and does not resemble the geometry of a real anatomical knee very well. "
"However, AnyBody also contains facilities for development of more "
"realistic geometries of surfaces such as the femoral condyles, and we "
"shall explore those in this lesson. We start from the model developed in "
"the second lesson. If you did not manage to obtain a working model from "
"the second lesson, then please download a new one :download:`here "
"<Downloads/DemoSimpleKnee2.any>`."

"In this example, we are modeling the knee joint using some simplified 2-D"
" implants (see picture) for the femoral head and the tibial plateau. To "
"do this, we add some STL surfaces for theses implants to the model and "
"use them to calculate a contact force, which changes the joint kinematics"
" by making the implant surfaces slide along each other in the simulated "
"motion."

"Due to the Force Dependent Kinematics (FDK), the joint axis for the knee "
"moves as a function of external forces and muscle forces. In this lesson "
"we want to have a closer look at this migration. We start by adding an "
"AnyDrawRefFrame to the KneeCenter node of the thigh and the shank "
"segments to show the migration. For the thigh segment we add"

"Now we start to add our new knee joint by adding the knee implant parts "
"to the model. We need the two STL files :download:`simplefemoral.stl "
"<Downloads/simplefemoral.stl>` and :download:`simpletibial.stl "
"<Downloads/simpletibial.stl>`. First, we define the femoral head as an "
"AnySurfSTL inside the KneeCenter and add an AnyDrawSurf object inside to "
"also be able to see the geometry:"

"The geometry of the tibial plateau would be a little bit misplaced if we "
"would just add it the same way as the femoral head. To adjust it to the "
"right position, we add a new node SurfSTLCenter centered at the right "
"position and define the AnySurfSTL inside this node:"

"When we now run the simulation and hide the blue cylinder in the knee "
"center, we can see that the surfaces penetrate each other quite a lot, so"
" just putting in the geometries into the model does not change anything "
"except that the locations of the two implants are now visible."

"Now, we want to make the surfaces slide along each other. Therefore, we "
"define a contact force that pushes the surfaces apart as soon as they are"
" in contact. We define an AnyForceSurfaceContact and place it just below "
"the definition of the Shank. For the definition an "
"AnyForceSurfaceContact, we have to specify the two contacting STL "
"surfaces (the first one is called master, the second is the slave "
"surface) and a pressure module. This pressure module is a constant "
"defining a linear law between penetration volume and force. In this "
"example we use a more or less arbitrary value for this module. Our "
"AnyForceSurfaceContact object looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ForceDependentKinematics/lesson4.rst:215
msgid ""
"The AnyForceSurfaceContact creates a 3-D force vector located in the "
"center of pressure whenever the volumes defined by the STL files "
"penetrate each other. If the volumes are not penetrating, these forces "
"just become zero."

"While running the analysis, we can see that in many steps the system "
"cannot be solved with the requested error tolerance. The reason for this "
"problem is that small changes in the position can result in big changes "
"in the contact force. Possibilities to improve this behavior are to "
"exchange the surface geometries and use finer meshes or to use a softer "
"contact by reducing the PressureModule."

"We are now done with this lesson. You can now play around with this model"
" by changing e.g. the pressure module to change the penetration of the "
"implants or the positions of the tibial part to change the motion. If you"
