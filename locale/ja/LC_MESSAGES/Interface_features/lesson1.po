"You can turn entire blocks of code into a comment by encapsulating it in "

"several lines by highlighting the block of lines and using the two "

"Please also notice the so-called Documentation Comments. These are "
"comments using the following syntactical forms:  ``/// ...`` , ``/** ... "
"*/`` , ``///< ...`` , and ``/**< ... */``. The Documentation Comments are"
" related to a given object in the model, and these comments are treated "
"specially so the information can be accessed more conveniently after "
"loading the model. Documentation comments appear in the object "
"descriptions of the model; it makes it easier to understand a model just "
