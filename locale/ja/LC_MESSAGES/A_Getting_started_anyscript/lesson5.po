"Skeletal muscles are very complicated mechanical actuators. They produce "
"movement by pulling on our bones in complicated patterns determined by "
"our central nervous system. One of the main features of AnyBody is that "
"the system is able to predict realistic activation patterns for the "
"muscles based on movement and external load."

"The behavior of real muscles depends on their operating conditions, "
"tissue composition, oxygen supply, and many other properties, and "
"scientists are still debating exactly how they work and what properties "
"are important for their function. In AnyBody, you can use several "
"different models for the muscles' behavior, and some of them are quite "
"sophisticated. Introducing all the features of muscle modeling is a "
"subject fully worthy of :doc:`its own tutorial "
"<../Muscle_modeling/intro>`. Here, we shall just define one very simple "
"muscle model and use it indiscriminately for all the muscles of the arm "
"we are building."

"Now we can start adding muscles. Remember that muscles cannot push, so to"
" allow a joint to move in both directions you have to define one muscle "
"on each side of the joint in two dimensions. If you work in three "
"dimensions and you have, say, a spherical joint, then you may need much "
"more muscles than that. In fact, it can sometimes be difficult to figure "

"We now have enough muscles in the model to start computing the muscle "
"forces that can drive the motion. But there is one more detail to take "
"care of, and it is both important and slightly intricate. The bottom line"
" is: There must be something for the muscles to drive - some load to "
"carry. We have not added any exterior forces to the model yet, but that "
"is not the problem. You remember, perhaps, from :doc:`Lesson 2 <lesson2>`"
" that each segment has mass. Additionally, the ArmModelStudy is equipped "
"with a standard gravity of -9.81 units in the global y direction. This "
"means that gravity actually provides the external force the analysis "

"What is the problem then? Well, unless you specify otherwise, drivers, "
"like the ones we added to the elbow and shoulder joints, act like motors."
" This means that they provide whatever moment or force might be necessary"
" to make the motion happen. Although it would be practical, few of us "
"have motors built into our joints. Instead, we have very efficient "
"muscles, so we want to leave the task of providing force in the model to "
"them. The way to do that is to set a property called Reaction.Type for "
"the driver to zero. This is how it's done for the shoulder:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This additional line makes sure that the driver provides the motion but "
"not the moment. Why would anyone ever want to model a joint with a motor "
"in it? Well, models under development often do not have enough muscles to"
" move. Such models will not work before the last muscle is added unless "
"they have motors in the drivers, and it is practical to be able to run an"
" analysis now and then during development to check that the model works "
"correctly."

"As you can see, the single Off is encapsulated in braces, {Off}. This is "
"because it is a vector. A driver by default has several components "
"depending on the number of joints it simultaneously drivers. Therefore "
"all the data in the driver is in vector quantities. For syntactic reasons"
" this applies even when the driver only controls one degree of freedom as"
" it does here."

"To see the results, you once again have to open a Chart window found in "

"Notice that the force in the muscle drops as the movement proceeds. This "
"is quite as expected because the moment arm of the gravity about the "
"elbow gets smaller as the elbow flexes, and less muscle force is "

"This muscle grows in force during the movement. That is because it is "

"elbow. In addition, it collaborates both with DeltoidusA on shoulder "

"Now that we have the analysis going, we might want to investigate the "
