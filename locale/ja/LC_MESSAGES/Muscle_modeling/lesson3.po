"Although the name of the muscle class we have used so far is "
"AnyMuscleViaPoint, the example has only shown the muscle passing in a "
"straight line between two points. Real muscles in the body rarely do so. "
"They are usually constrained by various obstacles on their way from "
"origin to insertion, either by connective tissues or by the contact with "
"bone surfaces."

"In the former case, the muscle tends to pass as a piecewise straight line"
" between the constrained points, and this is relatively easy to "
"accomplish by means of an AnyMuscleViaPoint. In the latter case, the "
"muscle may engage and release contact with the bone surfaces it "
"encounters. This wrapping over bones is a problem of contact mechanics "
"and optimization. It requires a different muscle class and it is "
"computationally much more demanding. In this lesson we shall look at "
"AnyMuscleViaPoints and postpone the discussion of wrapping to the next "
"lesson."

"Via point muscles pass through a set of at least two points on their way "
"from origin to insertion. Each of the via points must be attached to a "
"segment or the global reference frame of the model. The first and the "
"last of the point sequence are special because the muscle is rigidly "
"fixed to them and hence transfers forces in its local longitudinal "
"direction to them. Conversely, the muscle passes through the interior via"
" points like a thread through the eye of a needle. This means that the "
"muscle transfers only forces to interior via points along a line that "
"bisects the angle formed by the muscle on the two sides of the via point."

"A muscle can pass through an unlimited number of via points, and the "
"points can be attached to different segments. This can be used to create "
"rather complex kinematic behaviors of muscles, but it also requires care "
"in the definition to avoid unrealistic muscle paths when the via points "
"move around with the different segments."

"From-the-point of view of kinematic robustness, the wrapping muscles are "
"easier to handle than via point muscles, but the price is much higher "
