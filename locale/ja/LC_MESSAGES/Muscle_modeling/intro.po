"Muscles are the actuators of living bodies. They are activated by the "
"central nervous system (CNS) by a complicated electro-chemical process. "
"Determining the activation that realizes a desired movement requires an "
"extremely intricate control algorithm. The CNS is superior to any "
"computer man has made in this respect. AnyBody mimics the workings of the"
" CNS by computing backwards from the movement and load specified by the "
"user to the necessary muscle forces in a process known as inverse "
"dynamics. To do so, the system must know the properties of the muscles "
"involved, and this is where muscle modeling comes into the picture."

"AnyBody contains four different muscle models ranging from simple to more"
" complicated physiological behavior. The simplest model just assumes a "
"constant strength of the muscle regardless of its working conditions. The"
" more complicated models take such conditions as current length, "
"contraction velocity, fiber length, pennation angle, tendon elasticity, "
"and stiffness of passive tissues into account. Please refer to the "
"AnyScript Reference Manual (Find it in AnyBody->Help) for concise "
"information about the available muscle models:"
