"using a more basic representation of the L5 vertebra than the one "

"It starts with information on the included segment. All the geometrical "
"entries are listed. One nice feature here is that all coordinates stated "
"in this file are given in the same (global) coordinate system. In the "
"following all forces acting on the segment are listed. In this case one "
"of the artificial joint moment generating muscles is shown. The position "
"of the force is given as well as all of its components from AnyBody. "
"Depending on the nature of the underlying AnyForce class, which you can "
"see in the “Class” entry, there are a different number of forces and "
"moments listed. An AnyForce may have any number of components, which may "
"be a physical force or a torque, but it may also be a more generalized "
"load, not measured in Newton or Newton-meter. Basically these force "
"components are related to the underlying kinematic measure, so that force"
" times kinematic displacement becomes work/energy; in other words the "
"kinematic measure decides the unit of the force component. Anyway, these "
"occasionally somewhat artificial force measures present in the AnyBody "
"model are converted to real point forces and point torques, when "
"outputted to the AnyFE output file. Therefore, we find ``F[i]`` and "
"``M[i]`` in the AnyFE, which are the point force and the point torque "
"associated the *i*'th component of the given AnyForce object. The total "
"force acting in the global direction at a point can be found by simply "
"adding all the components forces, i.e. summing ``F[i]`` for all *i* at "
"that location."

"In many cases, the components are indeed simple such that component "
"``i=0`` for instance is ``Fx`` as could be expected, but since this "
"``Fx`` may refer to a local coordinate system of a particular segment, a "
"joint attachment node, or the like, ``F[i]`` and ``M[i]`` may still have "
"three non-zero values when exported to the AnyFE file. This is because "
"the data is tansformed while being exported so that the AnyFE is "
"referring to a single coordinate system for all of the exported data; "
"this system is often (by default) the global coordinate system or it can "
"be a local coordinate system."

"Next we need an object where we can apply our exported forces. This is "
"also quite simple. A facility is built in the system (from Version 3.1) "
"which allows the export of all .anysurf and .stl geometries from your "
"application in the .stl format. The function will export the geometry in "
"its actual position, so please make sure that your model has not been "
"reloaded since the force export otherwise run the InverseDynamicAnalysis "
"again to bring it to right position. Of course it also involves all "
"scaling which has been applied to the bones. Browse through the model "
"tree to the L5Seg "
"``Main/HumanModel/BodyModel/Trunk.SegmentsLumbar/L5Seg`` in order to "
"export the L5 segment. Inside this folder you find the DrawSTL folder. "
"Right-click the folder and choose “Export Surface”. Choose a convenient "
"place to store the file and give it the name “L5.stl”. A dialog box will "
"appear which allows you to specify a scale value for the output file. The"
" scaling can be useful to switch from one units system to another. In our"
" case we have m as units in the AMS, but want to have mm for the FE "
"geometry. So choose as scale factor 1000. From the AnyBody point of view,"
" that’s all we have to do. Please note that not all bones which are right"
" now in the Repository may be suitable for a FEA. As the main intention "
"is to have graphical representation of the body it may appear that some "
"bone are simply to coarse for a detailed analysis. But of course you are "
"free to import your own .stl file into the AnyBody Modeling System to "
"substitute existing bones. You will have to tweak your CAD file a bit in "
"order to make it fit. `Donation of better quality CAD files of bones to "
