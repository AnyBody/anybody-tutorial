"The tutorials are created using `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_, a"
" tool for software documentation. Sphinx converts ReStructuredText(.rst) "
"files into html, pdf or other formats. ReStructuredTexts are simple text "
"files with extra markup to define headers and formating. Having the "
"tutorials as ReStructuredText makes it easy to control changes to the "
"documents and ensure consistent style."

"The tutorials are automatically build with sphinx when commits are pushed"
" to the github repository. The process is handle by `Travis CI, here "
