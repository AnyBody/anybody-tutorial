"Before we look at the InitialConditions operation, let us just notice "
"that when the model is loaded, the segments of the model are positioned "
"in space according to their definition in terms of the r0 and Axes0 "
"properties in each segment's definition. These are called the load-time "
"positions."

"In the figure below, the user has tried to position the forearm and the "
"upper arm approximately at the right positions and angles at load time. "
"This is always a good idea, but it is almost impossible to get them "
"completely in place, and it is not necessary. Indeed, in more complicated"
" models, you can often find the segments and muscles in a big mess at "
"load time. Typically, you will want to see what the model looks like when"
" it has been assembled correctly for time step 1. This is what the "
"InitialConditions operation is for."

"The load-time positions of segments in a simple arm model. Notice that "
"the forearm and upper arm do not meet correctly at the elbow joint.*"

"When you run the InitialConditions operation, it will attempt to put the "
"model in the position is has at time = tStart. This may or may not be "
"possible, and in the development stages of a model, when the joints and "
"drivers are not yet fully defined, it is definitely not possible, and "
"this is the reason why the system does not do it automatically when you "
"load the model. Running the InitialConditions operation produces a "
"correctly assembled arm:"

"Here's a more detailed explanation: The system must perform a kinematical"
" analysis to connect the model correctly at the joints. This requires "
"that the model is kinematically determinate. Another way of expressing "
"that is that there must be the correct number of - and relationship "
"between joints and drivers in the model. It usually takes some iterations"
" in the model development to get it right. During these iterations it is "
"useful to be able to load the model and see a picture of it, and this is "
"why the loading simply positions the segments where the user placed them."

"Instead of simply running the InitialConditions operation, you can also "
"single-step through it to see what it does. This is done by clicking the "
"\"Step\" button instead of the \"Run\" button."

"The first step re-establishes the load-time conditions. This means that "
"it positions the model as it was when you loaded it. This is useful for "
"identification of kinematic problems. The second step positions the "
"segments honoring the joints. The third does not seem to do much, but it "
"is used for positioning muscles wrapping over surfaces. It is just not "
"visible in this simple model."
