# Finite Element Analysis Interfacing

This tutorial introduces the interface between the AnyBody Modeling System and
Finite Element systems.

Forces and segments from a model in AnyBody will be exported to provide the
boundary conditions of a finite element model. Special interface are available
for Ansys and Abaqus, but the generic output available to interface with other
system is also considered.
