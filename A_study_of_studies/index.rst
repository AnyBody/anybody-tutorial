A Study of Studies 
===================

In AnyBody, all types of analysis, whether pure mechanical system
analysis, musculoskeletal analysis or design analysis, are carried out
by objects that are referred to as "studies".

Studies have operations that can be executed to perform the analysis. The
objective of this tutorial is to explain the sequence of a typical study from
its mechanical system information, to the initial conditions, kinematics to the
inverse dynamic analysis.
