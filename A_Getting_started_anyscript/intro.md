# Getting started: AnyScript Programming

AnyScript is the model definition language of the AnyBody Modeling
System (AMS). It has been specially designed for describing the workings
of the human body and its interactions with environmental objects such as
exoskeletons, sports equipment, workplaces etc.

**In this tutorial, you will create your first AnyScript model, a
simplified model of an arm.**

Each lesson (after lesson 1) begins with a link to a file containing the
AnyScript code that has been introduced until that point. If you have a problem getting your to code work, simply
download the file and start from there.
