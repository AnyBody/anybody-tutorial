# Getting started: AnyScript Programming

This tutorial introduces the AnyScript modeling language, which is used
for all modeling in AnyBody.

You will get an understanding of the structure of the language, and key
modeling objects such as segments, joints, muscles, kinematics and forces will
be illustrated. A basic “arm” model will be created from scratch, with two
segments, joints and applied motion and forces.

Once you feel confident with these concepts you should move on to the next
chapter [Getting Started with Modeling](A_Getting_started_modeling) to create a more anatomically realistic
model using the full body model in the AMMR.
