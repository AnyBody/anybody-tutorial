# User interface features

The objective of this tutorial is to give an overview of the different
user interface features in the AnyBody Modeling System, including the
features of the Editor Window, the Model View, the various Model Tree
representations, and the graphing options.

Most of this tutorial is about the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of AnyBody
(AnyBody.exe), but the console application interface (AnyBodyCon.exe) is also
considered briefly.
