/* ---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple 2-D model of a body performing a squat movement.
Only the leg muscles are considered.

It is a slightly modified version of a model developed in 
cooperation with Bruce MacWilliams, Michael Anderson, and 
Kent Bachus of the Shriner's Hospital for Children in Salt
Lake City in Utah.

The leg has muscles with double strength, i.e., equivalent to
two legs. The movement of the arm of the model is controlled by means
of a Center-of-Gravity driver. This means that the arm is not
driven explicitly but simply assumes the position necessary to
maintain the position of the center of gravity.
