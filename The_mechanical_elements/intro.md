# The Mechanical Elements

{{ caution_old_tutorial }}

Musculoskeletal modeling is really just an advanced application of the
laws of mechanics described by one of the greatest scientists of all
times, Sir Isaac Newton, more than 300 years ago. So the elements of the
models you are working on in the AnyBody Modeling System are mostly
mechanical in nature, and to use them you must have sound understanding
of the laws of mechanics in general and of Newton's three laws of motion
in particular.

The mechanical elements of an AnyBody model are

- **Segments** used to represent bones and other rigid elements of models
- **Joints**
  used to connect segments and allow them to articulate with respect
  to each other
- **Drivers**
  used to specify the movement the model should perform and
  optionally provide power input as motors
- **Kinematic measures**
  abstraction representation of kinematical constraints
- **Forces**
  forces applied to the model

This tutorial also contains a short introduction to inverse dynamics and
how it differs from forward dynamics.

This tutorial consists of the following lessons:

- {doc}`Lesson 1: Segments <lesson1>`
- {doc}`Lesson 2: Joints <lesson2>`
- {doc}`Lesson 3: Drivers <lesson3>`
- {doc}`Lesson 4: Kinematic Measures <lesson4>`
- {doc}`Lesson 5: Forces <lesson5>`
