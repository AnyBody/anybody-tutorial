# Force-Dependent Kinematics

{{ caution_old_tutorial }}


The objective of this tutorial is to explain a feature of the AnyBody Modeling
System called force-dependent kinematics (FDK). This advanced feature allows the
user to alter motion in a joint depending on the acting forces from muscles,
ligaments, surfaces, etc.

FDK is particularly useful for modeling non-conforming joints and it also has
important applications for other types of models.
