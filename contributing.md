# Help improve tutorials

We highly appreciate any contributions to the Tutorials!

If you find typos, missing links or anything else wrong, don't hesitate to fix it.

It is as easy as forking [the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AnyBody/anybody-tutorial) , making your changes, and
issuing a pull request.  If you have any questions about this process don’t
hesitate to ask.

## Building the tutorials

The tutorials are created using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), a tool for software
documentation. Sphinx converts markup text files into html, pdf or other
formats.

All tutorials are written in Markdown, which are simple text files with extra markup to define headers
and formating. Having the tutorials as Markdown makes it easy to control
changes to the documents and ensure consistent style.

The tutorials are automatically build with sphinx when commits are
pushed to the github repository. The process is handle by
[Github Actions, here](https://github.com/AnyBody/anybody-tutorial/actions).
If the build fails, for example because of
wrong syntax etc, the Pull Request can not be merged.

Once the pull request is accepted on Github and the changes are merged to the
master branch the tutorials becomes availble online.

The newest released version of the tutorials are available at:

- <https://anyscript.org/tutorials/>

The newest development version (current master branch) is availble at:

- <https://anyscript.org/tutorials/dev/>

### Building the tutorials locally

Even though the tutorials are build automatically, it is also possible to build
them locally to view the layout and see results before pushing changes to the
server. It is often not necesssary when making small fixes to existing
tutorials. But when writing major new sections it nice to view how things look.

The easiest way to install needed packages tools, is to have the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads).

Then run the following commands to install the necesssary packages.

```bat
c:\path\to\anybody_tutorials> conda env create -f  environment.yaml
```

afterwards activate the environment where the sphinx has been installed:

```bat
c:\path\to\anybody_tutorials> conda activate sphinx
```

Now you can run the command to build the tutorial files.

```bat
c:\path\to\anybody_tutorials> make html
```

Once complete open the file: {file}`_build/html/index.html` in a browser to view
the result.

## Short Markdown guide

There are plenty of guides on Markdown available on Google. The tutorials uses a flavor of 
markdown called MySt designed for techincal documentaiton and publishing.

:::{seealso} The detailed documenation on [Markedly Structured Text (MySt)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.html) 
:::

So here is just a quick run through over some of the markdown concepts which are important for the tutorials.

### Paragraphs

Any block of text is a paragraph. Paragraphs must be separated by one
or more blank lines. Identation matters in markdown, so lines of the same
paragraph must be left aligned to the same indentation.

- one asterisk: {literal}`*text*` for emphasis (italics),
- two asterisks: {literal}`**text**` for strong emphasis (boldface), and
- backquotes: {literal}` \`text\` ` for code samples.

There are also options for {subscript}`subscript` and {superscript}`superscript` plus more:

```markdown
{subscript}`subscript` and {superscript}`superscript`
```

### Headers

```markdown
# Chapter header

## Section header

### Subsection header

```

### Lists and Quote-like

```markdown
- A bullet list item
- Second item

  - A sub item

1. Numbered list
2. It has two items
```

Quotes are just paragraph preseed with a `>` character.

```rst
This is an ordinary paragraph, introducing a block quote.

> "Don't panic"
> > -- HG2G
```

### Highlighting code

Highlighting AnyScript code snippets is also supported, using the `pygments_anyscript`
extension to pygments.

AnyScript highlighting is started using the `code-block`
directive and specifing `AnyScriptDoc` as the highlighting language.

```{eval-rst}
.. role:: red
```

```{raw} html
<style> .red {color:red} </style>
```

The `AnyScriptDoc` is highlighter specifically for the documentation in sphinx.
It can highlight AnyScript code even if the syntax is not correct, and any code
fenced with **§** is {red}`§marked in red§`.

Here is an example

````none

```AnyScriptDoc

AnyBodyStudy Study = {
    AnyFolder &Model = .Model;
    Gravity = {0.0, §-9.81§, 0.0};
}; // End of study
```

````

Which gives the following:

```AnyScriptDoc
AnyBodyStudy Study = {
    AnyFolder &Model = .Model;
    Gravity = {0.0, §-9.81§, 0.0};
}; // End of study
```

Valid values for the highlighting languages are:

- `none`: no highlighting
- `AnyScript`: AnyScript (Syntax must be valid)
- `AnyBodyDoc` AnyScript (Allows invalid syntax)
- `python/c++/ruby` Different known programming languages
- `markdown` Markdown
- ... and any other [lexer alias that Pygments supports](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).
