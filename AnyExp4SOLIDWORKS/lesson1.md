# Translating a SOLIDWORKS CAD model to AnyBody

Start by downloading the {download}`example SOLIDWORKS CAD assembly<Downloads/FitnessMachine_SolidWorks.zip>`

After having downloaded and opened this model in your SOLIDWORKS
environment, you will see the following image.

![SolidWorks fitnessmachine](_static/lesson1/lesson1_image1.png)

As you can see, this SOLIDWORKS assembly contains several parts and
mates. The assembly has three different configurations, each managing
different sets of mates. We will discuss the purpose of these different
configuration settings later.

The role of the mates in this model is as follows. The ‘MainBase’ part
should be fixed to the global origin. And the other parts should be
connected to this base and each other by the mates. The total number of
DOF (degrees-of-freedom) of this model should be one.

Let us try to translate this model into a corresponding AnyScript model.
If you have registered the AnyBody Exporter™ for SOLIDWORKS®
(AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS™) add-in successfully, then you will see the menu of
the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS add-in on the SOLIDWORKS menu like this:

![AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS menu](_static/lesson1/lesson1_image2.png)

Start the translation process by selecting the ‘Export to AnyScript’
menu item. Doing this will display the following dialog.

![AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS dialog](_static/lesson1/lesson1_image3.png)

In this dialog you can choose various options for the translation
process such as indentation method, constraint type for mates, STL file
type and so on. If you press the OK button after having decided the
options you want to use, you will see a file dialog asking you to choose
where your files will be saved. For this tutorial we shall use the
default options settings. You can change the location and the file name
to be what you want for this example.

If you look at the folder where you saved your own files, then you will
see that there are two AnyScript files (FitnessMachine.any and
FitnessMachine.main.any) and several STL files.

Let’s try to open the ‘FitnessMachine.main.any’ file using the AnyBody
Modeling System. It should look like this:

```AnyScriptDoc
...
// This AnyScript file was automatically generated by the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS translator add-in.
// Translation date: Wed Oct 17 14:09:24 2012
// AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS Version: 1.0.0
Main =
{
  #include "FitnessMachine.any"
};
```

This ‘FitnessMachine.main.any’ file just includes the
‘FitnessMachine.any’ file. When you load it, you will see that several
ANYSURF3 files are created from the STL files.

After loading this file, we should check which properties of the
SOLIDWORKS assembly could be translated into AnyScript. These properties
are:

- The SOLIDWORKS assembly model structure
- The part information (mass property, initial position, STL geometry
  file, color)
- Mate information between the different parts in the assemblies

## SOLIDWORKS assembly model structure

Let us compare the SOLIDWORKS Feature Tree and the AnyBody Model Tree.

![SOLIDWORKS properties](_static/lesson1/lesson1_image6.png)  ![ANYBODY model tree](_static/lesson1/lesson1_image7.PNG)

First, the top assembly ‘FitnessMachine’ is converted into a
corresponding AnyFolder object, which has the same name. All individual
parts are converted into corresponding AnySeg objects. Some reference
entities such as origin and planes are converted into AnyFixedRefFrame
or AnyRefNode objects depending on whether they are fixed or attached to
movable parts. Finally, there is an AnyFolder object named ‘Mates’,
which contains all converted mate information.

## Part information (mass property, initial position and STL geometry file)

If you look at the information about the
‘Main.FitnessMachine.MainBase\_\_\_1’ AnySeg object, you will see the
following piece of code.

```AnyScriptDoc
AnySeg MainBase___1 =
{
  r0 = {-0.1, 0.55, -8.455958313e-005};
  Axes0={ {1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1} };
  Mass = 73.1179928;
  Jii = {6.221732725, 13.35441288, 17.11071671};
  Jij = {0.5751545834, -0.0006960674174, -0.0005824144636};
  sCoM = {-0.189906896, -0.04988090848, 1.942340762e-005};
  JaboutCoMOnOff = On;
  AnyDrawSurf drw =
  {
    FileName = "FitnessMachine.MainCylinder_cfg0_9c1185a5c5e9fc546128.stl";
    Opacity = 1;
    RGB = {0.9098039216, 0.4431372549, 0.03137254902};
    AnyStyleDrawMaterial1 style =
    {
      EnableCreasing = On;
      CreasingAngle = 0.524;
    };
  };
  AnyRefNode Origin =
  {
    sRel = {0, 0, 0};
    ARel={ {1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1} };
  };
  ...
```

As you can see here, mass properties, initial position & rotation and
geometry information (STL file) were translated into AnyScript.

## Mate information

Generally, all mate information in a CAD assembly model can be regarded
as kinematic constraints. Based on these constraints, you can move the
assembly models inside the CAD system. All these mate objects are
translated into corresponding kinematics constraints in AnyScript, such
as AnyKinEq, AnyKinEqSimpleDriver or some standard joint types like
AnyRevoluteJoint, AnySphericalJoint..

Let us select one mate in the assembly and look at it in detail inside
SOLIDWORKS.

![SolidWorks assembly](_static/lesson1/lesson1_image8.png)

The ‘Concentric11’ mate was established between MainCylinder-1 and
BeamType1-2 components. In the above picture, the selected violet
cylinder is included in the MainCylinder-1 component, and
the selected orange point is included in the BeamType1-2 component. So
this mate is the concentric mate between a point and a cylinder. This
means that the orange point (on BeamType1\<2> component) can translate and
rotate on the axis of this violet cylinder (on MainCylinder\<1>). So this
mate can be translated into two linear constraints in the corresponding
AnyScript model.

The AnyScript code for the Concentric11 mate is as follows:

```AnyScriptDoc
AnyKinEqSimpleDriver Concentric11 =
{
  AnyKinLinear lin =
  {
    AnyRefFrame& base = ...MainCylinder___1.FitnessMachine_Concentric11;
    AnyRefFrame& target = ...BeamType1___2.FitnessMachine_Concentric11;
    Ref = 0;
  };
  MeasureOrganizer = {0, 1};
  DriverPos = {0, 0};
  DriverVel = {0, 0};
  CType = {.._ANY_CTYPE_, .._ANY_CTYPE_};
};
```

Where we notice that the 'MeasureOrganizer' selects two of the three
translational measurement defined by the AnyKinLinear object. The
following picture shows the relationship between these two components.

![SolidWorks Two components](_static/lesson1/lesson1_image9.png)

Here you can see that the AnyKinLinear kinematic measure, which is
defined between the ‘FitnessMachine_Concentric11’ AnyRefNode object of
the ‘BeamType1\_\_\_2’ AnySeg object (dark orange color) and the
‘FitnessMachine_Concentric11’ AnyRefNode object of the
‘MainCylinder\_\_\_1’ AnySeg object (cyan color), should have its x and
y coordinates as zero position and velocity values. The AnyRefNode
objects called ‘FitnessMachine_Concentric11’ on both AnySeg objects
were created automatically by the translation process for the sole
purpose of creating these constraints.

Finally notice that the ‘Reaction.Type’ of these constraints is ‘On’ as
default, since it has not been set by the translator. This implies that
reaction forces associated with the constraints are indeed active. Also
notice the constraint type ('CType'), which is set to parametric value,
'\_ANY_CTYPE\_', defined by the translator. The parameter,
'\_ANY_CTYPE\_', can later be modified in the AnyScript model, or by a
new translation of the model.

With this we will conclude our brief review of the translated model and
now let us go to the next {doc}`Lesson2. <lesson2>`
