Making Models using SOLIDWORKS 
===============================


This tutorial shows how a CAD model designed in SOLIDWORKS can be
imported into AnyBody and interact with the human model. This allows for
analysis and optimization of the ergonomics of products.

The AnyBody Exporter™ for SOLIDWORKS® (AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS™), is an add-in for
SOLIDWORKS, which allows export of SOLIDWORKS assembly models to AnyBody.

AnyBody and SOLIDWORKS is a powerful combination if you want to design and
analyze mechanical systems with a close relationship with human. It is
convenient to manage the model of your system in the CAD system with its
powerful design functionality and then transfer the model to AnyBody for
human-integrated mechanical analysis. AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS makes this transfer of
the model easy.

After finalizing your CAD model, then with the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS add-in
you can translate it into a corresponding AnyScript model. This
AnyScript model will include all mass properties, initial positions and
geometry information of all individual parts in your CAD assembly. Also
all the mate information of your CAD assembly will be translated into
several corresponding AnyScript constraint objects.
